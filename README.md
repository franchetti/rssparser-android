# rssparser-android [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/franchetti/rssparser-android.svg?branch=kotlin)](https://travis-ci.org/franchetti/rssparser-android)
## Description
This is a simple RSS parser app for Android.
It is written in Kotlin and wrapped with Gradle.
A device running Android 4.4W (API 20) or higher is required to run the app due to the use of some new design stuff, although the native app itself could run on API >= 14 devices.
